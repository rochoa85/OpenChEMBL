    		<h2>Welcome to Open ChEMBL</h2>
    		 <p>
            The aim of the Open ChEMBL Project is to make the process installing and running a local copy of the ChEMBL database as easy as possible. Additional goals of the Open ChEMBL Project included:
            </p>
              <ul>
                <li>The database we provide should be 'Chemically Aware', allowing users to run chemical substructure and similarity searches.</li>
                <li>The removal of any cost restrictions imposed to software licensing, so only freely available open-source software should be used in the project.</li>            
            </ul>
            <p>
            In order to achieve each of these goals we have created a Virtual Machine, which contains the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>PostgreSQL version of the ChEMBL database (Release: ChEMBL_14).</li>
              <li>The RDKit Chemical Cartridge, which is an open source software library and adds 'Chemical-Awareness' to a PostgreSQL database.</li>
              <li>A web application (this web application), which demonstrates some of the functionality of the RDKit Chemical Cartridge, such as chemical structure searching and chemical structure property calculations.*</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            *Note you do not need to use the web application and can connect directly to the database using PostgreSQL client.
            </p>

             Your feedback will help us determine how successful this project has been and also help drive the projects future direction. So please get in <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembldb/group/contact">get in touch</a> and share with us your Open ChEMBL comments and questions.

    	     <h3>Open ChEMBL Web Application Overview</h3>    			

             <p>
             The Open ChEMBL web application is used to expose some of the functionality provided by the RDKit Chemical Cartridge. It allows a user to draw or upload a chemical structures, which can then be used in <a href="structure.php">chemical structure searches</a> against the ChEMBL database or in <a href="property.php">chemical property calculations</a>. 
             Programmatic access to each of these services is also provided through a <a href="ws.php">RESTful Web Service</a>               
             </p>
